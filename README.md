# EcoNet
EcoNet applies machine learning to ecological data for insights and predictions. Using Python, R, Scikit Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Caret, Tidy Models, and Torch, we aim to address ecological challenges through data analysis and predictive modeling.

# Idea: 
EcoNet leverages machine learning methods to solve ecological problems. We'll use Python and R for data manipulation and ETL processes, with SQL for data extraction. Our machine learning models will be built using Scikit Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow for Python, and Caret, Tidy Models, and Torch for R. These models will tackle tasks like species distribution prediction, habitat classification, and ecosystem change detection. We'll maintain good Git practices for collaboration and version control. The project emphasizes continuous learning and improvement in machine learning and related mathematical topics.
