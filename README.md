# EcoNet: Machine Learning for Ecology

EcoNet is a machine learning project that applies advanced data analysis and predictive modeling techniques to address ecological challenges. 

## Technologies

We use a range of technologies and libraries for this project:

- **Python** and **R** for general programming and data analysis tasks.
- **SQL** for data extraction and querying.
- **Scikit Learn**, **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow** for Python machine learning tasks.
- **Caret**, **Tidy Models**, **Torch** for R machine learning tasks.
- **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.

## Roadmap

Here's a high-level overview of our project roadmap:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**: Gather ecological data from various sources and preprocess it for machine learning tasks. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming variables as needed.

2. **Model Development**: Develop machine learning models for various tasks, such as species distribution prediction, habitat classification, and ecosystem change detection. This will involve selecting appropriate models, training them on the data, and tuning their parameters for optimal performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and techniques, such as cross-validation and ROC curves. This will help us ensure that our models are accurate and reliable.

4. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the models so that they can be used to make predictions on new data. This could involve integrating the models into a web application, a mobile app, or a cloud-based API.

5. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Monitor the performance of the models over time and update them as needed. This could involve retraining the models on new data, adjusting their parameters, or even developing new models as needed.

6. **Continuous Learning and Improvement**: Continually update our knowledge and skills in machine learning, data analysis, and ecology. This could involve reading research papers, attending conferences, or taking online courses.

## Collaboration

We welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in machine learning and ecology. If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
